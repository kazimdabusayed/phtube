                    <li><b>Function Scope:</b> Variables declared with var have function-level scope, which means they
                        are visible and accessible throughout the entire function in which they are defined.</li>

                    <li><b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their enclosing function
                        or global scope. This means you can use a var variable before it is declared in your code, but
                        its value will be <b class="font-medium">undefined</b> until it is assigned a value.</li>

                    <li><b>No Block Scope:</b> Unlike let and const, var does not have block-level scope. It is not
                        confined to the nearest block (like <b class="font-medium">if</b> statements or loops) but
                        rather belongs to the entire function or global scope.</li>

                    <li><b>Block Scope:</b> Variables declared with let have block-level scope, which means they are only visible and accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined.</li>

                    <li><b>Hoisting:</b> Variables declared with let are also hoisted but not initialized. This means that you cannot access the variable before the let declaration in the code, unlike var.</li>

                    <li><b>Reassignment:</b> Variables declared with let can be reassigned with a new value.</li>

                    <li><b>Immutable:</b> Variables declared with const are constants and cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned to them. However, if the variable holds a reference to an object, the properties of the object can be modified.</li>

                    In JavaScript, null and undefined are both special values that represent the absence of a value or
                    the lack of a meaningful value. While they may seem similar, they have distinct use cases:

                <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                    <li><b>Intentional Absence:</b> 'null' is typically used when you want to explicitly indicate that a variable or object property intentionally has no
                    value or is empty.</li>

                    <li><b>User Initialization: </b>ou might set a variable to 'null' when you declare it but don't have a value to assign yet.</li>

                    <li><b>As a Placeholder: </b>It can be used as a placeholder value until an actual value is assigned or retrieved.</li>

                    <li><b>Comparison: </b> You can compare a variable to null to check if it has been intentionally set to no value.</li>

                    <li><b>Implicit Absence: </b>'undefined' is often the default value for uninitialized variables or object properties. It means that the variable or property hasn't been assigned any value.</li>

                    <li><b>Function Return: </b>When a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns 'undefined'.</li>

                    <li><b>Missing Function Arguments: </b>If a function is called with fewer arguments than expected, the missing arguments are undefined.</li>

                <p class="my-4 ml-6">
                    A REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a
                    set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It is an architectural
                    style for designing networked applications, particularly over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                    (HTTP), which is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web.
                </p>
            </div>
            <!--REST API part -->
            <div class="ml-6">
                <p class="mt-8 mb-4">Key principles and characteristics of REST APIs include:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
                    <li><b>Stateless: </b>Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed
                        to understand and fulfill the request. In other words, the server should not rely on any
                        previous requests. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to cache.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Resource-Based: </b>REST models resources as entities, such as objects, data, or services,
                        and each resource is identified by a unique URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Resources can
                        represent things like user profiles, articles, products, or any other data entities.</li>

                    <li><b>HTTP Methods:</b> REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to
                        perform actions on resources. For example, you might use a GET request to retrieve data, a POST
                        request to create a new resource, a PUT request to update an existing resource, and a DELETE
                        request to remove a resource.</li>

                    <li><b>CRUD Operations: </b>REST APIs often map CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to
                        HTTP methods. For example, GET for reading data, POST for creating data, PUT for updating data,
                        and DELETE for deleting data.</li>

                    <li><b>Uniform Interface: </b>REST APIs have a uniform and consistent way of interacting with
                        resources using HTTP methods and URLs. This consistency simplifies both client and server
                        implementation.</li>

                    <li><b>Representation: </b> Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML.
                        Clients can specify their preferred representation in the HTTP request headers, and servers will
                        respond accordingly.</li>

                    <li><b>Statelessness: </b>REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client
                        to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request.
                        Sessions and state are typically managed on the client side.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Layered System: </b>REST architecture allows for a layered system, where different components (e.g., load balancers, caching, security) can be added or modified without affecting the core functionality of the API.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br>
            <!-- summery -->
            <div class="ml-4">
                <p class="mt-4 mb-10">REST APIs are widely used for building web services and are popular for their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with HTTP, which is the foundation of the World Wide Web. They are commonly used in web and mobile application development to allow communication and data exchange between clients and servers.
